    "text": "Hello and welcome to my portfolio,\nI earned my bachelor’s degree in Land Economy with a focus on law, economics and their relations with the built environment at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana.\nAfter my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Teaching and Research Assistant at the Department of Land Economy, KNUST. I also worked as a Junior Technical Advisor(interned) with German Development Cooperation (GIZ) on the Resilience Against Climate Change Project which seeks to address the impacts of climate change on agriculture in the Northern part of Ghana to improve food security.\nMy firsthand experience with the impacts of climate change while working with GIZ inspired me to pursue the MGEM program at UBC Forestry. This program will equip me with the skills needed to monitor the damages and stressors on the environment and produce high-quality data to inform policies that will sustainably mitigate the pressing environmental challenges the world faces.\nGenerally, my interests are the creation and automation of geoinformatics tools, platforms, and spatial data infrastructures. My goal is to leverage my skillsets and technical expertise in GIS and Remote Sensing from my studies at UBC to work with government and non-profit organizations and contribute to projects that promote environmental planning, biodiversity conservation and wildfire management"

Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){ ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red) return(ndvi) }\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir.astype(float)-red.astype(float))/(nir.astype(float)+red.astype(float))\n  return(ndvi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a link to a Google Earth Engine application I developed. The full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
