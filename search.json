    "text": "I earned my bachelor’s degree in Land Economy with a focus on law, economics, finance and their relations with the built environment at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. After my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Teaching and Research Assistant at the Department of Land Economy, KNUST. I also worked as a Junior Technical Advisor(interned) with German Development Cooperation (GIZ) on the Resilience Against Climate Change Project, which seeks to address the impacts of climate change on agriculture in the Northern part of Ghana to improve food security.\nMy firsthand experience with the impacts of climate change while working with GIZ inspired me to pursue a professional Master’s degree in Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia(UBC). This program equipped me with the skills needed to monitor the damages and stressors on the environment and produce high-quality data to inform policies that will sustainably mitigate the pressing environmental challenges the world faces.\nCurrently, my goal is to leverage my skillsets and technical expertise in GIS and Remote Sensing from my studies to work with government and non-profit organizations and contribute to projects that promote environmental planning, biodiversity conservation and wildfire management. I have an interest in the creation and automation of geoinformatics tools, platforms, and spatial data infrastructures."

The final task involved a least-cost path analysis in ArcGIS Pro to study Grizzly Bear habitat and movement in western Alberta, a critical conservation issue. This project helped me apply GIS tools to real-world ecological challenges.\nThe map below was designed to illustrated the least cost path traveled by the bears in the region.\nIn this lab, I conducted a suitability analysis using geospatial tools to identify areas for marine conservation in Hawaii, focusing on the critical habitat of humpback whales. Through vector polygon overlay and database table intersection, I performed a marine spatial planning exercise to find the most suitable areas to expand the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. This analysis aimed to balance the growing conflict between whale habitat protection and human activities like vessel traffic. The lab allowed me to apply GIS tools to address conservation challenges and make data-driven decisions for marine resource management.\nThe map below was designed to illustrate the recommended the most suitable sanctuary location in the region.\nIn this lab, I worked with LiDAR data from the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest (MKRF) to create Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using different spatial interpolation methods. Spatial interpolation is essential for transforming discrete LiDAR point cloud data into continuous surfaces, enabling detailed terrain analysis. I explored various interpolation techniques, assessed their strengths and weaknesses, and compared the resulting DEMs to understand their differences. Additionally, I visualized point clouds and terrain models using GIS tools like QGIS and ArcGIS Pro. Through this lab, I developed key geospatial skills, including LiDAR data processing, spatial interpolation techniques, terrain modeling, and 3D visualization. I also strengthened my ability to analyze and interpret elevation datasets, assess the accuracy of different interpolation methods, and effectively communicate spatial data through maps and visual representations.\nThe panel of maps above show a comparison of DEMs generated using IDW, Natural Neighbor, and Spline Interpolation methods with the corresponding difference rasters."

Among the various heat mitigation strategies, urban tree shading has been identified as an effective solution for reducing surface and ambient temperatures, thereby lowering building cooling loads.\nThis study assesses the cooling benefits of tree shade on buildings in UBC neighbourhoods by analyzing the relationship between shade coverage and energy demand during summer. Using geospatial analysis and statistical modeling, LiDAR-derived shade rasters are overlaid on building footprints to quantify shade coverage. Regression models are then employed to assess the correlation between tree shade, surface temperature, and cooling energy demand.\nThe findings will provide insights into the extent to which urban tree shading contributes to energy conservation and inform tree-planting strategies to enhance thermal comfort and sustainability in UBC neighbourhoods.\n\n\nMethods overview:\nThe methods for this research involves several interconnected steps: pre-processing of LiDAR point cloud data to generate DSM and shade rasters, shade simulation and analysis for statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe animation shows the shade patterns estimated from the digital surface model for various times on the 21st day of June 2024. The image also shows the direction and length of the shadows/shades from trees at different time intervals\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaflet\nInteractive visualization of the shade frequency map at for June 21 at 18 : 45 PM\n\nlibrary(dplyr); library(leaflet);library(terra)\nshade &lt;- rast(\"C:/Users/isaac020.stu/OneDrive - UBC/Documents/GitHub/E-Portfolio/images/hillshade_18-45.tif\")\nm &lt;- leaflet() %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %&gt;%\n  addRasterImage(shade) %&gt;% \n  addScaleBar(position = c(\"bottomleft\"))\nm"

Lectures covered essential concepts like spatial heterogeneity, scale, and landscape connectivity. Lab sessions involved working with real-world data to quantify spatial patterns using software such as Fragstats. I learned how to calculate, interpret, and apply various metrics to assess landscape connectivity and spatial resilience.\nThroughout the course, I developed the skills to create spatial models and apply landscape ecology principles to solve environmental management issues. One of the most valuable aspects of the course was learning how patch-level decisions influence broader landscape dynamics and appreciating the relationship between spatial resilience and landscape changes in different systems, such as forests, urban areas, and agricultural landscapes.\nI gained a strong foundation in the application of landscape ecology tools, enabling me to approach natural resource management challenges with a deeper understanding of spatial patterns and their ecological significance."

    "text": "In this course, I was introduced to remote sensing techniques for gathering spatial information about the Earth’s surface, focusing on forestry, vegetation, and ecosystem management. I learned the fundamentals of spatial data capture, electromagnetic radiation, and the spectral properties of natural and manufactured materials. The course covered key sensor systems, including airborne and satellite sensors, and advanced image analysis techniques like LiDAR and RADAR.\nI also gained hands-on experience with digital image processing, including image rectification and classification. Additionally, I was introduced to R programming, focusing on processing spatial data and remote sensing imagery. I developed skills in creating tailored workflows, conducting spatial analysis, and generating scientific graphics. Through this course, I enhanced my abilities in sensor systems, image processing, and spatial data analysis, while building confidence in using software like ENVI, QGIS, and R to solve data-intensive problems.\nThis course introduced me to the fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and their applications in forestry, conservation, and natural resource management. Lectures covered key concepts like GIS database design, spatial analysis, and data visualization. Lab sessions provided hands-on experience with tools such as ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, GDAL, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Git, and Kart. I spent most of my time working with real-world geospatial datasets, performing spatial queries, analyzing geographic patterns, and creating maps for decision-making. Through this course, I developed skills in designing GIS databases, managing field data collection, and conducting spatial and logical queries.One of the most valuable aspects was creating maps that effectively communicate the results of geospatial analyses, reinforcing my technical and analytical skills.\nIn this lab, I worked with LiDAR data from the Malcolm Knapp Research Forest (MKRF) to detect individual trees using two methods: point cloud data and a canopy height model (CHM). The first part involved extracting point clouds from four plot locations and performing segmentation with the segment_trees function in the lidR package. I applied the li2012 algorithm to detect trees in a clearcut plot (Plot 1), focusing on the challenges of setting adaptive thresholds and using the speed_up parameter for efficiency. The goal was to segment individual trees by adjusting parameters such as dt1, dt2, and Zu, as suggested by Li et al. (2012). In the second part, I used the CHM-based Dalponte and Coomes 2016 algorithm to detect trees more accurately by analyzing height models and tree top locations. I created pit-free CHMs and located tree tops for segmentation, exploring different spatial resolutions to assess accuracy. I compared the outcomes from both methods and reflected on the best resolution for future analysis. Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience with advanced LiDAR tree segmentation techniques and developed a deeper understanding of how to apply different algorithms for forest structure analysis."

    "text": "I am a dagao and the plural form would be dagaaba or dagara. As a member of the dagaaba ethnic, I share very common ancestry with other groups including the Dagomba, Mossi, Kusasi and Farafara. We are all the direct descendants of a common and powerful ancestor called the Mabia whose legacy has significantly shaped our shared history today. The dagaaba group of people rebled and migrated away to gain their freedom from the autocratic rule of the Dagbon. Moving away from the wicked rule of the Dagbon, under the legendary Na Nyanse my ancestors moved far north of Ghana have occupied their present home land for over three hundred years. One key and interesting historical aspect of the dagaaba people is our creation story which is deeply rooted in the “Bagre” performance. “Bagre” performance is a ritual that demonstrates the spiritual significance of the environment and land to us as a people. This important ritual informs and reminds us that humans were created out the soil(earth), okra(plants), water (God’s saliva) and the semen and eggs of flies and cats(animals). We, as a people believe that the human is a configuration of the land, animal, the spirit and the plants. As such, these things must be preserved and be negotiated with as they are believed to have a closer affinity with divinity. As a result of my cultural orientation and background, I have grown to become someone who so much holds and believe in spirituality as well as a strong advocate of environmental preservation.\nI was born into the Kuugaayeng family which originated from the larger old Bonsing family, one of the indigenous settlers on the land in Sawale from my father’s side. My mother’s family although they are also dagaaba, they are however made up of the indigenous dagaaba and the Kusasi who intermarried and settled long enough on the land as well. My family has lived and worked in Sawale since the last two centuries. When my ancestors fled from the Dagbon rule and moved farther north, their first place of settlement before their present land was at Saawie. After settling there for close to a century, the tribe dispersed and moved further into northern Ghana towards and into Burkina Faso. As my family moved from Saawie to Sawale, they have lived and worked on their farms in Sawale till this day which is over two hundred years ago.\nGrowing up in Sawale, Ghana, education was never a priority in my community. This situation is attributable to great ignorance and financial constraints. My parents, both of whom are illiterates were not enthusiasts of education. They expected me to follow their footsteps as a farmer. Visionless and goalless as I was, I met one teacher at the Roman Catholic Church who saw the great potential in me and encouraged me to enroll to in school. She helped me get enrolled into their school and I sailed soundly through to the junior high level. After Junior High School, one Reverend Father, Peter Paul Yeletuo who admired my academic prowess supported me to get admission into the Minor Seminary where I took my secondary education. After secondary education, I went further to pursue BSc. Land Economy at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and I graduated with first class and as the second-best student from a class of 135. This academic milestone paved way for my pursuit of Geomatics for Environmental Management today.\nMany years before today, I never dreamt that I would get this far in life. My elder siblings dropped out of school because my parents could not fund their studies. After thorough retrospection and reflection on my life’s journey, I have come to deeply appreciate and value the importance of giving people the opportunity to realize their dreams. People saw my potentials, believed in me and invested in those potentials and I never disappointed them either. I believe that I owe humanity so much and it remains my greatest mission to contribute to humanity’s greatest need by giving back to society. I have thus come this far to read Master of Geomatics in Environmental Management to equip me with the skills I need to join forces to solve the environmental challenges the we all face which pose significant threats to the sustainability of human livelihood and biodiversity. Personally, Environmental Management is not just an academic pursuit, but a cultural and spiritual imperative. The significance of environment as demonstrated in the “bagre” performance coupled with people’s(dagaaba) reverence for land and nature has shaped my approach and quest to environmental preservation, making it both a personal and a necessity."
