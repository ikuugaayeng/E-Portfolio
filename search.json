    "text": "Hey there,\nI graduated from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology where I studied Bachelor of Science in Land Economy, a program which has the subtitles; environment, economics, and law. After my undergraduate studies, the Department of Land Economy, KNUST retained me to work as a Teaching and Research Assistant for the 2023/2024 academic year. But before I worked as a Teaching and Research Assistant, I had the opportunity to intern with the German Development Cooperation on the Resilience Against Climate Change Project which seeks to address the impacts of climate change on agriculture in the Northern part of Ghana to improve food security. During the internship, I worked as a Junior Technical Advisor in the IT unit and contributed in the development of a digital library, a crucial resource for disseminating knowledge on climate resilience and adaptation strategies. With over 8 billion people on Earth, our daily activities have a significant impact on the environment. I believe the MGEM program will equip me with the skills needed to monitor the damages and stressors on the environment and produce high-quality data to inform policies that will sustainably mitigate the pressing environmental challenges the world faces."

As your career progresses, this list may become quite long, so be sure to organize things. You may want to point to ‘most recent’ publications, or categorize things by project/topic."

    "text": "This is a sample page where you can archive project deliverables. Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){ ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red) return(ndvi) }\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir.astype(float)-red.astype(float))/(nir.astype(float)+red.astype(float))\n  return(ndvi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a link to a Google Earth Engine application I developed. The full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
