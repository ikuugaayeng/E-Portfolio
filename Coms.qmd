# Professional Communication in Forestry

This course was designed to enhance my communication skills in professional settings, particularly within forestry and environmental management. The course was delivered through a series of interactive seminars spanning the academic year, focusing on key aspects of communication, audience engagement, and message delivery.

Through lectures and discussions, I explored topics such as audience analysis, the role of positionality and power in communication, and strategies for managing difficult conversations. Practical sessions provided opportunities to refine my ability to convey specialized topics to diverse audiences and to adapt communication forms and mediums based on the context.

I developed skills in audience-specific messaging, conflict management, and effective collaboration within interdisciplinary teams. One of the most valuable aspects of the course was learning how to critically assess my own communication approach and apply empathy and self-awareness to professional interactions.

## My Positionality Statement
:::

I am a dagao and the plural form would be dagaaba or dagara. As a member of the dagaaba ethnic, I share very common ancestry with other groups including the Dagomba, Mossi, Kusasi and Farafara. We are all the direct descendants of a common and powerful ancestor called the Mabia whose legacy has significantly shaped our shared history today. The dagaaba group of people rebled and migrated away to gain their freedom from the autocratic rule of the Dagbon. Moving away from the wicked rule of the Dagbon, under the legendary Na Nyanse my ancestors moved far north of Ghana have occupied their present home land for over three hundred years. One key and interesting historical aspect of the dagaaba people is our creation story which is deeply rooted in the “Bagre” performance. “Bagre” performance is a ritual that demonstrates the spiritual significance of the environment and land to us as a people. This important ritual informs and reminds us that humans were created out the soil(earth), okra(plants), water (God’s saliva) and the semen and eggs of flies and cats(animals). We, as a people believe that the human is a configuration of the land, animal, the spirit and the plants. As such, these things must be preserved and be negotiated with as they are believed to have a closer affinity with divinity. As a result of my cultural orientation and background, I have grown to become someone who so much holds and believe in spirituality as well as a strong advocate of environmental preservation.

I was born into the Kuugaayeng family which originated from the larger old Bonsing family, one of the indigenous settlers on the land in Sawale from my father’s side. My mother’s family although they are also dagaaba, they are however made up of the indigenous dagaaba and the Kusasi who intermarried and settled long enough on the land as well. My family has lived and worked in Sawale since the last two centuries. When my ancestors fled from the Dagbon rule and moved farther north, their first place of settlement before their present land was at Saawie. After settling there for close to a century, the tribe dispersed and moved further into northern Ghana towards and into Burkina Faso. As my family moved from Saawie to Sawale, they have lived and worked on their farms in Sawale till this day which is over two hundred years ago.

Growing up in Sawale, Ghana, education was never a priority in my community. This situation is attributable to great ignorance and financial constraints. My parents, both of whom are illiterates were not enthusiasts of education. They expected me to follow their footsteps as a farmer. Visionless and goalless as I was, I met one teacher at the Roman Catholic Church who saw the great potential in me and encouraged me to enroll to in school. She helped me get enrolled into their school and I sailed soundly through to the junior high level. After Junior High School, one Reverend Father, Peter Paul Yeletuo who admired my academic prowess supported me to get admission into the Minor Seminary where I took my secondary education. After secondary education, I went further to pursue BSc. Land Economy at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and I graduated with first class and as the second-best student from a class of 135. This academic milestone paved way for my pursuit of Geomatics for Environmental Management today.

Many years before today, I never dreamt that I would get this far in life. My elder siblings dropped out of school because my parents could not fund their studies. After thorough retrospection and reflection on my life’s journey, I have come to deeply appreciate and value the importance of giving people the opportunity to realize their dreams. People saw my potentials, believed in me and invested in those potentials and I never disappointed them either. I believe that I owe humanity so much and it remains my greatest mission to contribute to humanity’s greatest need by giving back to society. I have thus come this far to read Master of Geomatics in Environmental Management to equip me with the skills I need to join forces to solve the environmental challenges the we all face which pose significant threats to the sustainability of human livelihood and biodiversity. Personally, Environmental Management is not just an academic pursuit, but a cultural and spiritual imperative. The significance of environment as demonstrated in the “bagre” performance coupled with people’s(dagaaba) reverence for land and nature has shaped my approach and quest to environmental preservation, making it both a personal and a necessity.
