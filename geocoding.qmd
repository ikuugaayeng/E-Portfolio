## [Geocoding]{#section1 .highlight-blue}

:::: row
::: col-md-7
This work focused mainly on how to import tabular data into ArcGIS Pro, create an address locator and geocode addresses, which is very essential in urban forestry.

The first task involved filtering street tree data to get trees with manually assigned addresses. I created a new field that merged house numbers and street names into a single address string. Using a custom-built address locator based on the Greater Vancouver road network, I geocoded these addresses and generated point features. Match scores were assessed to determine the reliability of the geocoded results. While most addresses returned perfect matches, a few with incomplete or fabricated values scored lower, illustrating common challenges with address-based data.

I also used coordinate data from a park tree inventory to create an XY event layer and converted it into a projected shapefile using the NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10N coordinate system. A spatial join with park polygon data was performed to count the number of trees per park, allowing tree density to be mapped and interpreted.

This analysis emphasized the importance of data preparation, spatial referencing, and quality assessment when working with address and coordinate-based datasets. The workflow is directly applicable to urban forest management and helps inform tree planting, maintenance, and policy planning.
