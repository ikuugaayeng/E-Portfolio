**Building Environmentally Resilient and Energy Efficient Open Spaces**
:::

In this project,Utilized innovative approaches to design public spaces that prioritize ecological sustainability, contribute to carbon sequestration, and provide opportunities for community-driven climate adaptation strategies using applications including ArcGIS Pro, QGIS and AutoCAD and Autodesk Revit. I applied the principles of urban resilience and sustainability in the design of this proposed public space by incorporating green infrastructure and nature-based solutions (NBS) to enhance climate resilience, reduce environmental impact, and improve community well-being,aligning with sustainable development principles.
