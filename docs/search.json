The final task involved a least-cost path analysis in ArcGIS Pro to study Grizzly Bear habitat and movement in western Alberta, a critical conservation issue. This project helped me apply GIS tools to real-world ecological challenges.\nThe map below was designed to illustrated the least cost path traveled by the bears in the region.\nIn this lab, I conducted a suitability analysis using geospatial tools to identify areas for marine conservation in Hawaii, focusing on the critical habitat of humpback whales. Through vector polygon overlay and database table intersection, I performed a marine spatial planning exercise to find the most suitable areas to expand the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. This analysis aimed to balance the growing conflict between whale habitat protection and human activities like vessel traffic. The lab allowed me to apply GIS tools to address conservation challenges and make data-driven decisions for marine resource management.\nThe map below was designed to illustrate the recommended the most suitable sanctuary location in the region.\nIn this lab, I worked with LiDAR data from the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest (MKRF) to create Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using different spatial interpolation methods. Spatial interpolation is essential for transforming discrete LiDAR point cloud data into continuous surfaces, enabling detailed terrain analysis. I explored various interpolation techniques, assessed their strengths and weaknesses, and compared the resulting DEMs to understand their differences. Additionally, I visualized point clouds and terrain models using GIS tools like QGIS and ArcGIS Pro. Through this lab, I developed key geospatial skills, including LiDAR data processing, spatial interpolation techniques, terrain modeling, and 3D visualization. I also strengthened my ability to analyze and interpret elevation datasets, assess the accuracy of different interpolation methods, and effectively communicate spatial data through maps and visual representations.\nThe panel of maps above show a comparison of DEMs generated using IDW, Natural Neighbor, and Spline Interpolation methods with the corresponding difference rasters."

This technology provides precise three-dimensional data about topography and surface features (Tooke et al., 2009).\nIn forestry, LiDAR is commonly used for mapping and assessing forests, including estimating tree heights and canopy structures (Roussel et al., 2020).

    "text": "I am a dagao and the plural form would be dagaaba or dagara. As a member of the dagaaba ethnic, I share very common ancestry with other groups including the Dagomba, Mossi, Kusasi and Farafara. We are all the direct descendants of a common and powerful ancestor called the Mabia whose legacy has significantly shaped our shared history today. The dagaaba group of people rebled and migrated away to gain their freedom from the autocratic rule of the Dagbon. Moving away from the wicked rule of the Dagbon, under the legendary Na Nyanse my ancestors moved far north of Ghana have occupied their present home land for over three hundred years. One key and interesting historical aspect of the dagaaba people is our creation story which is deeply rooted in the “Bagre” performance. “Bagre” performance is a ritual that demonstrates the spiritual significance of the environment and land to us as a people. This important ritual informs and reminds us that humans were created out the soil(earth), okra(plants), water (God’s saliva) and the semen and eggs of flies and cats(animals). We, as a people believe that the human is a configuration of the land, animal, the spirit and the plants. As such, these things must be preserved and be negotiated with as they are believed to have a closer affinity with divinity. As a result of my cultural orientation and background, I have grown to become someone who so much holds and believe in spirituality as well as a strong advocate of environmental preservation.\nI was born into the Kuugaayeng family which originated from the larger old Bonsing family, one of the indigenous settlers on the land in Sawale from my father’s side. My mother’s family although they are also dagaaba, they are however made up of the indigenous dagaaba and the Kusasi who intermarried and settled long enough on the land as well. My family has lived and worked in Sawale since the last two centuries. When my ancestors fled from the Dagbon rule and moved farther north, their first place of settlement before their present land was at Saawie. After settling there for close to a century, the tribe dispersed and moved further into northern Ghana towards and into Burkina Faso. As my family moved from Saawie to Sawale, they have lived and worked on their farms in Sawale till this day which is over two hundred years ago.\nGrowing up in Sawale, Ghana, education was never a priority in my community. This situation is attributable to great ignorance and financial constraints. My parents, both of whom are illiterates were not enthusiasts of education. They expected me to follow their footsteps as a farmer. Visionless and goalless as I was, I met one teacher at the Roman Catholic Church who saw the great potential in me and encouraged me to enroll to in school. She helped me get enrolled into their school and I sailed soundly through to the junior high level. After Junior High School, one Reverend Father, Peter Paul Yeletuo who admired my academic prowess supported me to get admission into the Minor Seminary where I took my secondary education. After secondary education, I went further to pursue BSc. Land Economy at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and I graduated with first class and as the second-best student from a class of 135. This academic milestone paved way for my pursuit of Geomatics for Environmental Management today.\nMany years before today, I never dreamt that I would get this far in life. My elder siblings dropped out of school because my parents could not fund their studies. After thorough retrospection and reflection on my life’s journey, I have come to deeply appreciate and value the importance of giving people the opportunity to realize their dreams. People saw my potentials, believed in me and invested in those potentials and I never disappointed them either. I believe that I owe humanity so much and it remains my greatest mission to contribute to humanity’s greatest need by giving back to society. I have thus come this far to read Master of Geomatics in Environmental Management to equip me with the skills I need to join forces to solve the environmental challenges the we all face which pose significant threats to the sustainability of human livelihood and biodiversity. Personally, Environmental Management is not just an academic pursuit, but a cultural and spiritual imperative. The significance of environment as demonstrated in the “bagre” performance coupled with people’s(dagaaba) reverence for land and nature has shaped my approach and quest to environmental preservation, making it both a personal and a necessity."

This technology provides precise three-dimensional data about topography and surface features (Tooke et al., 2009).\nIn forestry, LiDAR is commonly used for mapping and assessing forests, including estimating tree heights and canopy structures (Roussel et al., 2020). In urban planning, it supports applications such as land use planning and infrastructure development (Dawood et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n\nLiDAR systems are broadly categorized into two main types: Discrete Return LiDAR and Full Waveform LiDAR. Each type collects data differently and serves distinct purposes depending on the application.\nDiscrete Return LiDAR, commonly used in terrestrial and airborne surveys, captures distinct return points from each laser pulse, producing a 3D point cloud of the scanned environment.\nFull Waveform LiDAR records the entire energy profile of the returning signal, offering a continuous vertical representation of surfaces, which is especially useful for analyzing complex vegetation structures or terrain in satellite-based applications.\n\n Figure 3: Types of LiDAR from Salas (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n✈️ Airborne LiDAR Mounted on drones or aircraft to map forests and terrain from above.\n\n\n🌲 Terrestrial LiDAR Stationary ground-based scanners used for capturing tree trunks and structural details.\n\n\n🛰️ Spaceborne LiDAR Satellite-based systems used for global ecosystem monitoring and elevation mapping.\n\n\n🚗 Mobile LiDAR Mounted on vehicles or backpacks for scanning roads and built environments while in motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiDAR works by emitting laser pulses from a sensor mounted on an aircraft or ground-based device. These laser pulses interact with objects and the Earth’s surface and then bounce back to the sensor.

This data is valuable for various applications, including forestry (like estimating tree heights and canopy structure), urban planning, flood modeling, and more. LiDAR technology provides highly accurate and detailed structural information, making it essential for many scientific and environmental studies.\nThe most common format for discrete-return LiDAR point cloud data is a LAZ file (e.g., lidar_data.laz).

Lectures and hands-on exercises covered essential Python concepts, including syntax, data structures, control flow, and scripting, with a focus on processing and analyzing geospatial data. I gained experience working with Jupyter Notebooks, standalone Python scripts, and tools like Visual Studio Code, while using geo-focused libraries such as GDAL, Geopandas, and Rasterio.\nThrough working with real-world datasets from UBC’s Malcolm Knapp Research Forest and coastal northwest Madagascar, I developed practical skills in querying, manipulating, and analyzing spatial data to address environmental management challenges like landscape change, ecological resilience, and carbon monitoring. This course strengthened my ability to transition from using graphical GIS tools to developing custom geospatial workflows with Python, enhancing both my technical programming abilities and my analytical approach to solving spatial problems."
