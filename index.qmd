Hey there,

I graduated from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology where I studied Bachelor of Science in Land Economy, a program which has the subtitles; environment, economics, and law. After my undergraduate studies, the Department of Land Economy, KNUST retained me to work as a Teaching and Research Assistant for the 2023/2024 academic year. But before I worked as a Teaching and Research Assistant, I had the opportunity to intern with the German Development Cooperation on the Resilience Against Climate Change Project which seeks to address the impacts of climate change on agriculture in the Northern part of Ghana to improve food security. During the internship, I worked as a Junior Technical Advisor in the IT unit and contributed in the development of a digital library, a crucial resource for disseminating knowledge on climate resilience and adaptation strategies. With over 8 billion people on Earth, our daily activities have a significant impact on the environment. I believe the MGEM program will equip me with the skills needed to monitor the damages and stressors on the environment and produce high-quality data to inform policies that will sustainably mitigate the pressing environmental challenges the world faces.
