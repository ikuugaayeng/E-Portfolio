## Bio

I am a motivated Geomatics professional with **3+** years of hands-on experience working to deliver innovative solutions to support municipal level infrastructure planning, environmental and natural resource management and to advance climate resilience and risk adaptation projects and initiatives across Canada and Ghana. In 2025, I graduated with a masterâ€™s degree in Geomatics for Environmental Management from the University of British Columbia where I completed a capstone project that focused on the cooling impacts of shades for reduced energy consumption and neighborhood climate adaptation to ensure sustainable living in the residential neighborhoods.

Currently, I am interning as a GIS Analyst with Social Planning Cowichan, where I support an Indigenous-led cedar restoration and protection project. This initiative is focused on mitigating the loss of cedar trees, a cultural keystone species, that is threatened by climate change and land development in the Cowichan Region on Vancouver Island.

With prior experience working with Municipal governments, international organizations and academic institutions on projects spanning from planning to climate mitigation and research, I am passionate about using GIS to inform sustainable natural resource and environmental management, infrastructure planning, and climate resilience strategies.
